**1. Introduction & Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the **Reflective Learning Agent**. This AI-powered tool aims to guide users through a structured reflection process following a specific event, task, or learning experience. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) orchestrated by an agentic framework (LangGraph), the agent will engage the user in a brief, guided dialogue, culminating in a concise summary of their key takeaways. This MVP focuses on validating the core user experience and technical feasibility of the agentic conversational flow.

**2. Goals & Objectives**

**2.1. Product Goals:**

* Validate the core user value proposition: Does AI-guided reflection provide a useful and efficient way for users to process experiences?
* Test the technical feasibility of using LangGraph and LLMs for stateful, guided conversational flows, including a basic self-correction mechanism.
* Establish a foundational codebase and agent architecture for future development in AI-driven performance and wellbeing tools.
* Gather qualitative user feedback to inform future iterations.

**2.2. User Goals:**

* Provide a simple, low-friction way to initiate reflection on a recent event/task.
* Be guided by relevant questions that encourage deeper thinking than unstructured self-reflection.
* Receive a concise, useful summary of the reflection session's key insights.

**2.3. Business Goals (Internal):**

* Develop internal expertise and reusable components for agentic AI systems (conversational management, state tracking, basic agent self-correction).
* Create a tangible internal demo showcasing agent capabilities.

**2.4. Success Metrics (MVP):**

* **Task Completion Rate:** >70% of initiated reflection sessions are completed through the summary stage.
* **Qualitative Feedback:** Positive sentiment regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use gathered from min. 5 user feedback sessions (internal pilot users).
* **Technical Stability:** <5 critical errors per 100 sessions during internal testing (tracked via logging/monitoring).
* **Core Flow Implementation:** Successful demonstration of the defined LangGraph flow, including the dialogue states and basic internal correction check.

**3. Target Audience**

* **Primary (MVP):** Internal Team Members (Pilot Users). Individuals in roles requiring continuous learning, adaptation, or processing of complex interactions (e.g., engineers post-incident review, PMs post-feature launch, customer support post-difficult call).
* **Persona (Illustrative):** "Alex, the Growth-Minded Professional" - Busy, motivated to learn from experiences but often lacks the time or structure for effective reflection. Values efficiency and actionable insights.

**4. Use Cases / User Stories**

* **UC-1:** As Alex, after finishing a challenging project meeting, I want to quickly start a reflection session about it so I can process what happened while it's fresh.
* **UC-2:** As Alex, during the reflection, I want to be asked relevant questions about the meeting (e.g., what went well, what was difficult) so I can articulate my thoughts clearly.
* **UC-3:** As Alex, at the end of the reflection, I want to receive a short summary of the key points I discussed so I have a clear takeaway.

**5. Functional Requirements (MVP Scope)**

**FR1: Session Initiation**
* FR1.1: User must be able to initiate a reflection session via a defined interface (API endpoint or basic Streamlit UI).
* FR1.2: User can optionally provide a brief text input defining the reflection topic (e.g., "Sprint Retrospective"). If no topic is provided, the agent uses a generic prompt.

**FR2: Guided Dialogue (Agent Interaction)**
* FR2.1: `Initiator Agent`: Presents the first open-ended question based on the topic (or generically if no topic provided). (e.g., "Let's reflect on [topic]. What are your initial thoughts?").
* FR2.2: `Probing Agent`:
    * Takes the user's response to the previous question.
    * Uses an LLM to generate *one* relevant follow-up question (MVP focus: simple "what went well?", "what was challenging?", "what did you learn?" variants based loosely on user input).
    * Presents the follow-up question to the user.
* FR2.3: Conversation State: The system must maintain the context of the current dialogue turn (user input, agent response) to inform the next step in the LangGraph flow.

**FR3: Summarization**
* FR3.1: `Summarizer Agent`:
    * Takes the dialogue history (initial prompt + user responses + probing questions) as input.
    * Uses an LLM to generate a concise summary (target: 3-5 bullet points or a short paragraph) capturing the key themes/points discussed.
* FR3.2: Presentation: The generated summary is presented to the user via the interface.

**FR4: Basic Internal Self-Correction**
* FR4.1: `Correction Agent` (Internal): Before FR3.2, this agent performs a *single, basic* quality check on the generated summary using an LLM. (e.g., Prompt: "Does this summary [summary text] seem coherent and relevant to the topic of [topic]? Respond YES or NO.").
* FR4.2: Re-Summarization Trigger: If the `Correction Agent` check returns "NO" (or equivalent negative signal), the `Summarizer Agent` (FR3.1) is triggered *one* more time, potentially with a modified prompt (e.g., "Generate a more focused summary based on..."). The result of this second attempt is then presented (FR3.2) without a further check for MVP.

**FR5: Session Conclusion**
* FR5.1: After presenting the summary, the agent provides a concluding message (e.g., "Reflection complete. Hopefully, this was helpful!").

**FR6: Minimal Viable Interface**
* FR6.1: Provide functional API endpoints (e.g., using FastAPI) for initiating, interacting turn-by-turn, and receiving the final summary. Document these endpoints.
* FR6.2: (Optional but Recommended) Provide a simple Streamlit application that consumes these API endpoints for easier internal testing and demos.

**6. Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)**

* **NFR1: Usability:** Interaction flow must be logical and require minimal instructions for a pilot user via the chosen interface.
* **NFR2: Reliability:** The core agent workflow must handle typical text inputs without unhandled exceptions. Implement basic error handling for LLM API calls (e.g., timeout, retry logic).
* **NFR3: Latency:** Response time for each agent turn (including LLM call) should ideally be under 15 seconds to maintain user engagement. This is a target, not a hard requirement, acknowledging external LLM variability.
* **NFR4: Data Privacy:** No persistent storage of full conversation transcripts beyond the active session state required for the workflow. Only anonymized interaction data (e.g., session duration, completion status) should be logged for metrics, if any. Final summaries are not stored in this MVP.

**7. Design & UX Considerations (MVP)**

* **Interaction Model:** Turn-based dialogue via API or simple chat-like interface (Streamlit).
* **Core Flow Diagram:** [Include a simple diagram showing states: Start -> Get Topic -> Initiate Question -> Get Response -> Probe Question -> Get Response -> Summarize -> Internal Check -> (Re-Summarize if needed) -> Present Summary -> End]
* **UI (If Streamlit):** Minimalistic. Clear distinction between user input areas and agent responses. Focus on readability. No complex styling required.

**8. Release Criteria (MVP)**

* All Functional Requirements (FR1-FR6) are implemented and demonstrably working via API calls and/or Streamlit interface.
* The internal self-correction loop (FR4) functions as defined (triggers re-summarization on basic failure condition).
* Unit tests cover any non-LLM utility functions. End-to-end tests demonstrate the core conversational flow successfully.
* Basic logging implemented for key events and errors.
* Code is linted, reasonably commented, and reviewed.
* API endpoints are documented (e.g., via FastAPI auto-docs).

**9. Future Considerations / Out of Scope (MVP)**

* **Out of Scope:**
    * Adaptive multi-turn probing dialogues.
    * Advanced self-correction criteria and iterative refinement.
    * Sentiment analysis influencing dialogue.
    * Goal-setting agent post-summary.
    * User accounts or profiles.
    * Persistent storage and retrieval of past reflections.
    * Vector databases / semantic search over reflections.
    * Sophisticated UI/UX design.
    * Deployment to scalable production infrastructure (MVP runs locally or in basic dev environment).
    * A/B testing different prompts or agent logic.
    * Integration with external tools (calendars, task managers).
* **Future Considerations:** Items listed above, particularly enhancing the conversational depth, implementing robust data persistence and retrieval, adding goal-setting capabilities, and improving the UI/UX based on feedback.

**10. Open Questions & Assumptions**

* **Assumption:** Access to a suitable LLM API (specify which one, e.g., OpenAI GPT-4/3.5, Claude) is available and performs adequately for conversational tasks.
* **Assumption:** Basic LangGraph framework is suitable for managing the defined conversational states and transitions.
* **Assumption:** Users understand the purpose of reflection and will provide reasonably thoughtful (though not necessarily lengthy) inputs.
* **Open Question:** What specific LLM prompts provide the most effective probing questions and accurate summaries? (Requires experimentation during development).
* **Open Question:** What is the actual perceived latency tolerance for users interacting with the agent?
